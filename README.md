# rprog-data-ProgAssignment3-data
Programming assignment 3 for R programming course. I created best.R to find the best hospital given a State and one of 
three medical outcomes. The function “best” reads in the *.csv of outcomes, checks the validity of arguments, selects 
the right data, and outputs the hospital with the minimum mortality in the selected state for the selected medical condition.
