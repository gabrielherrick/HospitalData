# Three functions to query hospital data in R
This repo contains three functions that query a dataset and return requested information in a tidy format. All three draw from the outcome-of-care-measures.csv dataset. "best.R" returns the best hospital in a given state for a given outcome. "rankhospital.R" retuns the hospital in a given state of a given rank, and "rankall.R" returns the nth best hospital for every state in a given outcome.
